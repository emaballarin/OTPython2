# OTPython2

A fast and lightweight Gilbert Vernam's One Time Pad cipher implementation in Python 2, using Caesar's rotors.

This implementation is toy-level and does *not* use bit-XOR or other best practices for electronics-based cryptography. On the other hand, this implementation is easily reproducible by hand, mechanically, or anyhow without computational means.

**NOTE:** Beware that the code is currently unmaintained and is not suitable for non-educational purposes.
